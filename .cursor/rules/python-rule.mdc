# Python Best Practices

## Project Structure

- Use src-layout with `src/your_package_name/`
- Place tests in `tests/` directory parallel to `src/`
- Keep configuration in `config/` or as environment variables
- Use the "uv" library to manage the python environment and install the necessary packages.
- Place static files in `static/` directory
- Use `templates/` for Jinja2 templates

## Code Style

- **Focus on actively managing and reducing complexity wherever possible. Complexity is the enemy.**
- Follow Black code formatting
- Use isort for import sorting
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions:
  - snake_case for functions and variables
  - PascalCase for classes
  - UPPER_CASE for constants
- Maximum line length of 88 characters (Black default)
- Use absolute imports over relative imports

- Focus on the specific task that we spoke about. Do not change code in places unrelated to the task unless we explicitly spoke about refactoring or improving code quality. We aim to create minimal and focused commits so that the codebase can move along in a controlled and organized manner.

## Type Hints

- Use type hints for all function parameters and returns
- Import types from `typing` module
- Use `Optional[Type]` instead of `Type | None`
- Use `TypeVar` for generic types
- Define custom types in `types.py`
- Use `Protocol` for duck typing
